HuskySchedule is currently being developed by InfyMedia. The goal of the project is to provide a place for students at the University of Washington to more efficiently shop for classes and plan their schedules and academic careers.

HuskySchedule is currently not hosted for public use, as the UI is still being developed. However, HuskySchedule's back-end would be a good starting point for any project that needs access to UW course data, which includes:
> a data parser of University of Washington course information that requires no special     access, ie. it parses the public html pages that the UW provides.

> and a complete and flexible database schema for UW courses.

For now we encourage anyone to use the back-end that we have built to build whatever course related system they would like, and eventually we hope to make a simple xml api available that will provide this data through simple HTML queries. It is important to note that such xml apis have existed in the past the difference is unlike our api, other apis have always required UW NetID or other more stringent credentials to use them, most likely because they gave information beyond the scope of the public data provided by the UW.
